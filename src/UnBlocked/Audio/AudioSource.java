 * This is an Audio Source which can play Audio from whatever Audio Buffers you want.

 * Sounds in OpenAL are divided into two parts:
 * -The Sound Buffer, which contains the Sound itself
 * -and the Sound Source, which is effectivly a Speaker for the sound to be played from.
 * 
 * If you wanted to play multiple of the same sound concerrently, you can just
 * use multiple Sound Sources to play from the same Sound Buffer.
